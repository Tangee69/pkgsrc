What is rake-compiler?

rake-compiler is first and foremost a productivity tool for Ruby developers.
Its goal is to make the busy developer's life easier by simplifying the
building and packaging of Ruby extensions by simplifying code and reducing
duplication.

It follows convention over configuration by advocating a standardized build
and package structure for both C and Java based RubyGems.

rake-compiler is the result of many hard-won experiences dealing with
several diverse RubyGems that provided native extensions for different
platforms and different user configurations in different ways.  Details such
as differences in code portability, differences in code clarity, and
differences in project directory structure often made it very difficult for
newcomers to those RubyGems.

From these challenges, rake-compiler was born with the single-minded goal of
making the busy RubyGem developer's life much less difficult.
