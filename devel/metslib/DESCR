METSlib: a metaheuristic framework.
-----------------------------------

This project is under development and, althought useful, must be
reviewed to be ready for anyone to use.

METSlib is an OO (Object Oriented) metaheuristics optimization
framework in C++ designed to make easy implementing or adapting
models. The model is modular: all the implemented search algorithms
can be applied to the same model.

Once the model is implemented one can test some Tabu Search Strategies
or Simulated Annealing or other local search based search strategies.

METSlib is Open Source and is covered by the GNU GPL license or, at
your option, by the Common Public License 1.0. Commercial licensing
or custom development can be considered by the author upon request.
