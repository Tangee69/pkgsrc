Blosc is a high performance compressor optimized for binary data (i.e. floating
point numbers, integers and booleans, although it can handle string data too).
It has been designed to transmit data to the processor cache faster than the
traditional, non-compressed, direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() OS
call. Blosc main goal is not just to reduce the size of large datasets on-disk
or in-memory, but also to accelerate memory-bound computations.

C-Blosc2 is the new major version of C-Blosc, and is backward compatible with
both the C-Blosc1 API and its in-memory format. However, the reverse thing is
generally not true for the format; buffers generated with C-Blosc2 are not
format-compatible with C-Blosc1 (i.e. forward compatibility is not supported).
In case you want to ensure full API compatibility with C-Blosc1 API, define the
BLOSC1_COMPAT symbol.
