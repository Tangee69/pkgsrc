Glasgow Interface Explorer is a tool for exploring digital interfaces, aimed at
embedded developers, reverse engineers, digital archivists, electronics
hobbyists, and everyone else who wants to communicate with a wide range of
digital devices with high reliability and minimum hassle. It can be connected
to most digital interfaces without additional active or passive components, and
includes extensive protection from unexpected conditions and operator error.

The Glasgow hardware can support many digital interfaces because it uses
reconfigurable logic. Instead of only offering a small selection of standard
hardware supported interfaces, it uses an FPGA to adapt on the fly to the task
at hand without compromising on performance or reliability, even for unusual,
custom, or obsolete interfaces.

The Glasgow software is a set of building blocks designed to eliminate
incidental complexity. Each interface is packaged into a self-contained applet
that can be used directly from the command line, or reused as a part of a more
complex system. Using Glasgow does not require any programming knowledge,
although it becomes much more powerful if you know a bit of Python.
