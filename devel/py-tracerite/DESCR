TraceRite hides the irrelevant IPython/notebook internals and concisely shows
what happened (the program was interrupted) and where that happened. This could
further be improved by converting the KeyboardInterrupt message into something
more suitable, like "You stopped the program", but what you see above is just
the default handling that never considered this particular error.
