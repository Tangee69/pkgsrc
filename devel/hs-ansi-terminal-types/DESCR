The 'ANSI' standards refer to the visual style of displaying characters as
their 'graphic rendition'. The 'ANSI' codes to establish the graphic
rendition for subsequent text are referred to as SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION
(SGR). This package exposes modules that export types and functions used to
represent SGR aspects.
