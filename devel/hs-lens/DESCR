This package comes "Batteries Included" with many useful lenses for the types
commonly used from the Haskell Platform, and with tools for automatically
generating lenses and isomorphisms for user-supplied data types.

The combinators in Control.Lens provide a highly generic toolbox for composing
families of getters, folds, isomorphisms, traversals, setters and lenses and
their indexed variants.

An overview, with a large number of examples can be found in the README
(https://github.com/ekmett/lens#lens-lenses-folds-and-traversals).
