CLI11 is a command line parser for C++11 and beyond that provides a
rich feature set with a simple and intuitive interface.

CLI11 provides all the features you expect in a powerful command line
parser, with a beautiful, minimal syntax and no dependencies beyond
C++11. It is header only, and comes in a single file form for easy
inclusion in projects. It is easy to use for small projects, but
powerful enough for complex command line projects, and can be
customized for frameworks. It is tested on Azure and GitHub Actions,
and was originally used by the GooFit GPU fitting framework. It was
inspired by plumbum.cli for Python.
