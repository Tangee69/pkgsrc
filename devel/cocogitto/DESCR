Cocogitto is a CLI and GitOps toolbox for the Conventional Commits and
Semver specifications.

Cocogitto was designed to help you respect the conventional and semver standard
and is not intended to be used in any other context.

It strives to be a set of simple, modern and fast command line interfaces.

Goals
 - Make using the conventional commits spec easy and fun.
 - Enable people to focus on their work instead of correcting small mistakes
   and typos.
 - Enforce correctness regarding Semver and Conventional Commits.
 - Automate things when possible (ex: bumping versions).

Non goals
 - Cocogitto is not a git replacement. It uses some of libgit2 but only to
   provide features related to the Conventional Commits specification.
   Anything else shall be done with git.
 - Supporting other commit conventions or git workflows.
