A pytest plugin that allows multiple failures per test.

Normally, a test function will fail and stop running with the first
failed `assert`.  That's totally fine for tons of kinds of software
tests.  However, there are times where you'd like to check more
than one thing, and you'd really like to know the results of each
check, even if one of them fails.

`pytest-check` allows multiple failed "checks" per test function,
so you can see the whole picture of what's going wrong.
