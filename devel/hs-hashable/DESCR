This package defines a class, Hashable, for types that can be converted to a
hash value. This class exists for the benefit of hashing-based data structures.
The package provides instances for basic types and a way to combine hash values.

Hashable is intended exclusively for use in in-memory data structures.

Hashable does not have a fixed standard. This allows it to improve over time.

Because it does not have a fixed standard, different computers or computers on
different versions of the code will observe different hash values. As
such, hashable is not recommended for use other than in-memory datastructures.
Specifically, hashable is not intended for network use or in applications which
persist hashed values. For stable hashing use named hashes: sha256, crc32,
xxhash etc.
