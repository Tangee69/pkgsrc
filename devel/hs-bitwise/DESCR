Unboxed multidimensional bit packed Bool arrays with fast aggregate
operations based on lifting Bool operations to bitwise operations.

There are many other bit packed structures out there, but none met all of
these requirements:

1. unboxed bit packed Bool array,
2. multi-dimensional indexing,
3. fast (de)serialization, or interoperable with foreign code,
4. fast aggregate operations (fold, map, zip).
