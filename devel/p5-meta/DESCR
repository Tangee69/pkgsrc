This package provides an API for metaprogramming; that is, allowing
code to inspect or manipulate parts of its own program structure.
Parts of the perl interpreter itself can be accessed by means of
"meta"-objects provided by this package. Methods on these objects
allow inspection of details, as well as creating new items or
removing existing ones.
