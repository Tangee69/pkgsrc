The Go language provides an internal testing library, named testing,
which is relatively slim due to the fact that the standard library
correctness by itself is verified using it. The check package, on the
other hand, expects the standard library from Go to be working
correctly, and builds on it to offer a richer testing framework for
libraries and applications to use.

gocheck works as an extension to the testing package and to the "go
test" runner. That allows keeping all current tests and using
gocheck-based tests right away for new tests without conflicts. The
gocheck API was purposefully made similar to the testing package for a
smooth migration.
