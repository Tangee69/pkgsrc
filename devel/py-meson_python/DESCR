meson-python is a Python build backend built on top of the Meson
build system. It enables use of Meson for the configuration and
build steps of Python packages. Meson is an open source build system
meant to be both extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as
user friendly as possible. meson-python is best suited for building
Python packages containing extension modules implemented in languages
such as C, C++, Cython, Fortran, Pythran, or Rust.
