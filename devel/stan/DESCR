Stan is a command-line tool for analysing Haskell projects. It discovers
which parts of the code can potentially be improved, and offers suggestions
on how to do so. Stan is searching for not only performance or error-prone
code pieces, but it also can help with establishing and applying
best-practices from the whole Haskell ecosystem.

Although Haskell is a statically typed language, not all properties can be
encoded in types. Even though GHC is quite a powerful compiler, it tries to
be library-agnostic and provide only language-specific suggestions, while
Stan uses the knowledge about the current state of the ecosystem and
commonly used libraries.

You will find Stan helpful if you enjoy writing in Haskell, but want more
guarantees from your code, not provided by the Haskell type system or GHC.
