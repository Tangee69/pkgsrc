inline-snapshot can be used for different things:

* golden master/approval/snapshot testing. The idea is that you
  have a function with a currently unknown result and you want
  to write a tests, which ensures that the result does not change
  during refactoring.

* Compare things which are complex like lists with lot of numbers
  or complex data structures.

* Things which might change during the development like error
  messages.

inline-snapshot automates the process of recording, storing and
updating the value you want to compare with. The value is converted
with repr() and stored in the source file as argument of the
snapshot() function.
