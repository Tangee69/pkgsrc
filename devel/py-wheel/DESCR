This is a command line tool for manipulating Python wheel files, as
defined in PEP 427. It contains the following functionality:

  - Convert .egg archives into .whl
  - Unpack wheel archives
  - Repack wheel archives
  - Add or remove tags in existing wheel archives

Historical note

This project used to contain the implementation of the setuptools
bdist_wheel command, but as of setuptools v70.1, it no longer needs
wheel installed for that to work. Thus, you should install this only
if you intend to use the wheel command line tool!
