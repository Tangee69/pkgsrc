GNU hypertext utilities to view and manipulate info
documentation files.

The GNU project has a hypertext system called Info which allows the
same source file to be either printed as a paper manual, or viewed
using info.  It is possible to use the info program from inside Emacs,
or to use the stand- alone version described here.

This package can convert info to pdf, if pdftex (print/tex-pdftex) and
pdflatex (print/tex-latex-bin) are installed.  However, it does not
depend on them.
