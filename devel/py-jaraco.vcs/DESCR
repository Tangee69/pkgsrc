jaraco.vcs provides classes for inspecting and working with repositories in the
Mercurial and Git version control systems (VCS).

The classes provided are designed to use subprocess invocation to leverage the
command-line interfaces of the VCS tools hg and git. An in-process RepoManager
for Mercurial exists but has been disabled due to issues that arise when run in
certain environments (namely setuptools sandboxing).
