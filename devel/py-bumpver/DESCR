With the CLI command bumpver, you can search for and update version
strings in your project files. It has a flexible pattern syntax to
support many version schemes (SemVer, CalVer or otherwise). BumpVer
features:

- Configurable version patterns
- Optional Git or Mercurial integration
- Works with plaintext, so you can use it with any project.
