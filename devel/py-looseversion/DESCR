A backwards/forwards-compatible fork of `distutils.version.LooseVersion`,
for times when PEP-440 isn't what you need.

The goal of this package is to be a drop-in replacement for the original
`LooseVersion`. It implements an identical interface and comparison logic to
`LooseVersion`. The only major change is that a `looseversion.LooseVersion` is
comparable to a `distutils.version.LooseVersion`, which means tools should not
need to worry whether all dependencies that use LooseVersion have migrated.

If you are simply comparing versions of Python packages, consider moving to
`packaging.version.Version', which follows PEP-440. `LooseVersion` is better
suited to interacting with heterogeneous version schemes that do not follow
PEP-440.
