# Tests for the : operator in dependency declarations.

# TODO: Implementation

# In a dependency declaration line, there may be a shell command after the
# sources.  It is separated by a semicolon.  This "feature" is required by
# POSIX.  It is seldom used, if at all.

# The semicolon for separating the sources from the creation commands must
# appear at the top-level.  The semicolons inside the :S;1;2; modifier are
# skipped when looking for the semicolon that separates the sources from
# the commands.
