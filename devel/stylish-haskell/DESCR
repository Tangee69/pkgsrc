A simple Haskell code prettifier. The goal is not to format all of the code
in a file, since I find those kind of tools often "get in the
way". However, manually cleaning up import statements etc. gets tedious
very quickly.

This tool tries to help where necessary without getting in the way.

Features:
* Aligns and sorts import statements
* Groups and wraps {-# LANGUAGE #-} pragmas, can remove (some) redundant
  pragmas
* Removes trailing whitespace
* Aligns branches in case and fields in records
* Converts line endings (customizable)
* Replaces tabs by four spaces (turned off by default)
* Replaces some ASCII sequences by their Unicode equivalents (turned off by
  default)
* Format data constructors and fields in records.
