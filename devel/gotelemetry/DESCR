This package contains the gotelemetry tool, which allows opting in or
out from Go telemetry reporting. It will also let you see local
telemetry data in a web interface.

Note that by default, uploading telemetry data is always disabled. Run
"gotelemetry on" to enable collection and upload of telemetry data.
