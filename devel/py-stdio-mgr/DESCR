This modules helps in automating testing actual console input &
output of user-facing components.

While some functionality here is more or less duplicative of
redirect_stdout and redirect_stderr in contextlib within the standard
library, it provides (i) a much more concise way to mock both stdout
and stderr at the same time, and (ii) a mechanism for mocking stdin,
which is not available in contextlib.
