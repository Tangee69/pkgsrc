Ruff-lsp is a Language Server Protocol implementation for Ruff,
an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.

Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins),
Black, isort, pyupgrade, and more, all while executing tens or
hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff-lsp enables Ruff to be used in any editor that supports
the LSP, including Neovim, Sublime Text, Emacs and more. For
Visual Studio Code, check out the Ruff VS Code extension.

Ruff-lsp supports surfacing Ruff diagnostics and providing
Code Actions to fix them, but is intended to be used alongside
another Python LSP in order to support features like navigation
and autocompletion.
