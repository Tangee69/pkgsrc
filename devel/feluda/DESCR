Feluda is a Rust-based command-line tool that analyzes the dependencies of a
project, notes down their licenses, and flags any permissions that restrict
personal or commercial usage.

Features:
- Parse your project to identify dependencies and their licenses.
- Classify licenses into permissive, restrictive, or unknown categories.
- Flag dependencies with licenses that may restrict personal or commercial use.
- Output results in plain text, JSON or TUI formats. There's also a gist format
  which is available in strict mode to output a single line only.
