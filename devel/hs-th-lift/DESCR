Derive Template Haskell's Lift class for datatypes using TemplateHaskell. The
functionality in this package has largely been subsumed by the
DeriveLift language extension, which is available in GHC 8.0 and later versions.
As such, this package is only useful as a way to backport bugfixes
to DeriveLift in later GHC versions back to older GHCs.

The following libraries are related:

* The th-orphans
  (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-orphans) packageprovides instances
  for template-haskell syntax types.
* The th-lift-instances
  (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-lift-instances)package
  provides Lift instances for types in base, text,bytestring, vector, etc. Some
  of these instances are only provided forold versions of their respective
  libraries, as the same Lift instancesare also present upstream on newer
  versions.
