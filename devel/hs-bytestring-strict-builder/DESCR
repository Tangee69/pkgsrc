According to the competition benchmarks
(https://github.com/nikita-volkov/bytestring-builders-benchmark), this
library provides on average the fastest builder of strict
bytestrings. Practical benchmarks have proven it to be highly performant as
well. The encoders from the "postgresql-binary" library have shown a stable
performance improvement by factors of up to 10 after the migration from the
standard builder to "bytestring-strict-builder".
