Bugdom is a 1999 Macintosh game by Pangea Software. You play as Rollie
McFly, a pill bug on a quest to save ladybugs from King Thorax's iron grip
on the Bugdom.

This port aims to provide the best way to experience Bugdom today. It
introduces some modern comforts (such as support for arbitrary resolutions)
and fixes some gameplay bugs. The overall experience is intended to be
faithful to the spirit of the original game, so modifications to the game's
design are out of the scope of this project.
