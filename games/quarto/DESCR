The game is played on a 4x4 board with 16 pieces. Each piece has four distinct
characteristics: size, color, shape and fill.
On your turn, you choose one of the 16 pieces and give it to your opponent.
Your opponent then places that piece on any empty space on the board.

The first player to create a row of four pieces with at least one matching
characteristic wins the game. Matching characteristics can be in any direction,
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In the harder square mode, (-q), a square of 4 is also considered a win.

If all 16 pieces have been placed and there is no winner, the game is a tie.
