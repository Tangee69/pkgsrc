You can run the X11 NetHack by typing "nethack".
Select the windowing type with "OPTIONS=windowtype:x11" in your
$HOME/.nethackrc. Other possible values are "curses" and "tty".

Two fonts were installed for NetHack.  The nethack wrapper script
adds ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/X11/misc to fontpath. You can set one of

NetHack*map*font: nh10
NetHack*map*font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-ibmpc-14-120-75-75-c-80-iso8859-1

in ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/app-defaults/NetHack to use it.
Tiled mode is enabled by:

NetHack.tile_file: x11tiles

Also see ${PREFIX}/share/nethackdir360/nethack.x11.rc

You may also want to set this environment variable, so NetHack can
find its app-defaults file:

XFILESEARCHPATH=%D:/usr/pkg/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:/usr/pkg/lib/X11/%T/%N

but the nethack wrapper script sets XUSERFILESEARCHPATH for you.
