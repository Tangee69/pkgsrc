Celeste is a platform game developed and published by indie studio Maddy
Makes Games. The player controls Madeline, a young woman with anxiety and
depression who aims to climb Celeste Mountain. During her climb, she encounters
several characters, including a personification of her self-doubt known as
Badeline, who attempts to stop her from climbing the mountain.

This is a C source port of the original Celeste (Celeste Classic for the
PICO-8), designed to be portable.
