Red Eclipse is a fun-filled new take on the casual first person arena
shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself
toward a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of agility in a variety of
environments.

NOTE: This package provides the older 1.6 version based on Cube Engine, and
the older map collection. Use the 'games/redeclipse' package for the newest
version of the game.
