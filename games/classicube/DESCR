ClassiCube is a custom Minecraft Classic compatible client written in C from
scratch.

ClassiCube aims to replicate the 2009 Minecraft Classic client while offering
optional enhancements to improve gameplay.

ClassiCube is not trying to replicate modern Minecraft versions. It will
never support survival, logging in with Minecraft accounts or connecting to
Minecraft servers.  It is not affiliated with (or supported by) Mojang AB,
Minecraft, or Microsoft in any way.
