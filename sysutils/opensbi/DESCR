The goal of the OpenSBI project is to provide an open-source reference
implementation of the RISC-V SBI specifications for platform-specific
firmwares executing in M-mode.

The RISC-V Supervisor Binary Interface (SBI) is the recommended interface
between:

    - platform-specific firmware running in M-mode and a bootloader, a
      hypervisor or a general-purpose OS executing in S-mode or HS-mode.
    - hypervisor running in HS-mode and a bootloader or a general-purpose
      OS executing in VS-mode.
