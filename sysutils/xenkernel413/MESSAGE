$NetBSD: MESSAGE,v 1.2 2023/08/23 10:30:49 bouyer Exp $

The Xen hypervisor is installed under the following locations:
	${XENKERNELDIR}/xen.gz		(standard hypervisor)
	${XENKERNELDIR}/xen-debug.gz	(debug hypervisor)

Note that unlike upstream Xen, pv-linear-pt defaults to true.
You can disable it using pv-linear-pt=false on the Xen command line,
but then you can't boot NetBSD in PV mode.

WARNING: Note that this version is now unsupported upstream and will be
removed from pkgsrc after the pkgsrc-2023Q3 branch.
