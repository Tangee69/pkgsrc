Tool to enable writing one file scripts in languages that require compilation,
dependencies fetching or preprocessing.

It works as a "shebang" for those scripts, extracting build instructions from
comments. If a script is changed, scriptisto rebuilds it and caches the result.
If a script was already built, scriptisto immediately delegates to a binary
with only <1 ms overhead.
