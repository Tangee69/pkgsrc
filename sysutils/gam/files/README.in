When gam is first run, it will walk you through the steps to create
a Google project and use oauth2 to grant access to the required
scope. This setup procedure will generate 3 files (oauth2.txt,
oauth2service.json and client_secrets.json) which are used by gam
to access your Google tenancy. It is important that they are kept
secure as anyone who has access to those files can make changes
to your Google settings.

The files will be placed in @PKG_SYSCONFDIR@ by default.
To override this location, set the following environmental variables:

OAUTHFILE = path to oauth2.txt
OAUTHSERVICEFILE = path to oauth2service.json
CLIENTSECRETS = path to client_secrets.json
