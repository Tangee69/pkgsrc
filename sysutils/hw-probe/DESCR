A tool to probe for hardware, check operability and find drivers
with the help of BSD hardware database.

Probe is a snapshot of your computer hardware state and system
logs.  The tool checks operability of devices by analysis of logs
and returns a permanent URL to view the probe of the computer.

The tool is intended to simplify collecting of logs necessary for
investigating hardware related problems.  Just run one simple
command (requires superuser privileges) in the console to check
your hardware and collect all the system logs at once:

    # hw-probe -all -upload

By creating probes you also contribute to the HDD/SSD reliability
test study (https://github.com/bsdhw/SMART).
