fclones is a command line utility that identifies groups of identical
files and gets rid of the file copies you no longer need. It comes
with plenty of configuration options for controlling the search
scope and offers many ways of removing duplicates. For maximum
flexibility, it integrates well with other Unix utilities like
`find` and it speaks JSON, so you have a lot of control over the
search and cleanup process.
