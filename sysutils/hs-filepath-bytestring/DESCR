This package provides functionality for manipulating RawFilePath values. It
can be used as a drop in replacement for the filepath library to get the
benefits of using ByteStrings. It provides three modules:

* System.FilePath.Posix.ByteString manipulates POSIX/Linux style
  RawFilePath values (with / as the path separator).

* System.FilePath.Windows.ByteString manipulates Windows style RawFilePath
  values (with either \ or / as the path separator, and deals with drives).

* System.FilePath.ByteString is an alias for the module appropriate to your
  platform.

All three modules provide the same API, and the same documentation (calling
out differences in the different variants).
