+We provide make_catalog_backup as an example of what can be used to backup
+your Bacula database.  We expect you to take security precautions relevant
+to your situation.  make_catalog_backup is designed to take a password on
+the command line.  This is fine on machines with only trusted users.  It is
+not acceptable on machines without trusted users.  Most database systems
+provide a alternative method, which does not place the password on the
+command line.
+
+The make_catalog_backup contains some warnings about how to use it. Please
+read those tips.
+
+To help you get started, we know PostgreSQL has a password file,
+\elink{
+.pgpass}{http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/libpq-pgpass.html}, and
+we know MySQL has
+\elink{ .my.cnf}{http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/password-security.html}.
+
+Only you can decide what is appropriate for your situation. We have provided
+you with a starting point.  We hope it helps.
