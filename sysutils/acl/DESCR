This package provides POSIX ACL interfaces on Linux; these interfaces
are typically missing on Linux systems.  Specifically, it contains the
getfacl and setfacl utilities and a library "libacl", as well
as headers and man pages.  When this package is installed on Linux,
one can build programs that expect POSIX ACLs.
