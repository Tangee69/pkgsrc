Dinit is a service supervisor with dependency support which can also act as the
system "init" program. It was created with the intention of providing a portable
init system with dependency management, that was functionally superior to many
extant inits. Development goals include clean design, robustness, portability,
usability, and avoiding feature bloat (whilst still handling common - and some
less-common - use cases). Dinit is designed to integrate with rather than
subsume or replace other system software.
