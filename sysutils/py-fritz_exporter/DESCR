This is a prometheus exporter for AVM Fritz! home network devices
commonly found in Europe. This exporter uses the devices builtin
TR-064 API via the fritzconnection python module.

The exporter should work with Fritz!Box and Fritz!Repeater Devices
(and maybe others). It actively checks for supported metrics and
queries the for all devices configured (Yes, it has multi-device
support for all you Mesh users out there.)
