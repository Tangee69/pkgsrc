.SH Eza Color Explanation
.PP
eza provides its own built-in set of file extension mappings that cover a large range of common file extensions, including documents, archives, media, and temporary files.
Any mappings in the environment variables will override this default set: running eza with \fB\fCLS_COLORS="*.zip=32"\fR will turn zip files green but leave the colours of other compressed files alone.

.PP
You can also disable this built-in set entirely by including a
\fB\fCreset\fR entry at the beginning of \fB\fCEXA_COLORS\fR\&.
So setting \fB\fCEXA_COLORS="reset:*.txt=31"\fR will highlight only text
files; setting \fB\fCEXA_COLORS="reset"\fR will highlight nothing.

eza now supports bright colours! As supported by most modern 256-colour terminals, you can now choose from \fB\fCbright\fR colour codes when selecting your custom colours in your \fB\fC#EXA_COLORS\fR environment variable.

"Immediate" files are the files you should look at when downloading and building a project for the first time: READMEs, Makefiles, Cargo.toml, and others.
They are highlighted in \fIyellow\fP and \fIunderlined\fP\&.

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Images (png, jpeg, gif) are purple.
.IP \(bu 2
Videos (mp4, ogv, m2ts) are a slightly purpler purple.
.IP \(bu 2
Music (mp3, m4a, ogg) is a deeper purple.
.IP \(bu 2
Lossless music (flac, alac, wav) is deeper than \fIthat\fP purple. In general, most media files are some shade of purple.
.IP \(bu 2
Cryptographic files (asc, enc, p12) are a faint blue.
.IP \(bu 2
Documents (pdf, doc, dvi) are a less faint blue.
.IP \(bu 2
Compressed files (zip, tgz, Z) are red.
.IP \(bu 2
Temporary files (tmp, swp, ~) are grey.
.IP \(bu 2
Compiled files (class, o, pyc) are faint orange. A file is also counted as compiled if it uses a common extension and is
in the same directory as one of its source files: styles.css will count as compiled when next to styles.less or styles.sass, and scripts.js when next to scripts.ts or scripts.coffee.
