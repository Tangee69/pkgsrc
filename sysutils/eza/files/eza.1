.SH NAME
.PP
eza — a modern replacement for ls


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCeza [options] [files...]\fR

.PP
\fBeza\fP is a modern replacement for \fB\fCls\fR\&.
It uses colours for information by default, helping you distinguish between many types of files, such as whether you are the owner, or in the owning group.

.PP
It also has extra features not present in the original \fB\fCls\fR, such as viewing the Git status for a directory, or recursing into directories with a tree view.

.TP
\fB\fCeza --long --header --inode --git\fR
Displays a table of files with a header, showing each file’s metadata, inode, and Git status.

.TP
\fB\fCeza --long --tree --level=3\fR
Displays a tree of files, three levels deep, as well as each file’s metadata.

.TP
\fB\fC--no-git\fR
Don't show Git status (always overrides \fB\fC--git\fR, \fB\fC--git-repos\fR, \fB\fC--git-repos-no-status\fR)


.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
eza responds to the following environment variables:

.SH \fB\fCCOLUMNS\fR
.PP
Overrides the width of the terminal, in characters, however, \fB\fC-w\fR takes precedence.

.PP
For example, ‘\fB\fCCOLUMNS=80 eza\fR’ will show a grid view with a maximum width of 80 characters.

.PP
This option won’t do anything when eza’s output doesn’t wrap, such as when using the \fB\fC--long\fR view.

.SH \fB\fCEXA_STRICT\fR
.PP
Enables \fIstrict mode\fP, which will make eza error when two command-line options are incompatible.

.PP
Usually, options can override each other going right-to-left on the command line, so that eza can be given aliases: creating an alias ‘\fB\fCeza=eza --sort=ext\fR’ then running ‘\fB\fCeza --sort=size\fR’ with that alias will run ‘\fB\fCeza --sort=ext --sort=size\fR’, and the sorting specified by the user will override the sorting specified by the alias.

.PP
In strict mode, the two options will not co-operate, and eza will error.

.PP
This option is intended for use with automated scripts and other situations where you want to be certain you’re typing in the right command.

.SH \fB\fCEXA_GRID_ROWS\fR
.PP
Limits the grid-details view (‘\fB\fCeza --grid --long\fR’) so it’s only activated when at least the given number of rows of output would be generated.

.PP
With widescreen displays, it’s possible for the grid to look very wide and sparse, on just one or two lines with none of the columns lining up.
By specifying a minimum number of rows, you can only use the view if it’s going to be worth using.

.SH \fB\fCEXA_ICON_SPACING\fR
.PP
Specifies the number of spaces to print between an icon (see the ‘\fB\fC--icons\fR’ option) and its file name.

.PP
Different terminals display icons differently, as they usually take up more than one character width on screen, so there’s no “standard” number of spaces that eza can use to separate an icon from text. One space may place the icon too close to the text, and two spaces may place it too far away. So the choice is left up to the user to configure depending on their terminal emulator.

.SH \fB\fCNO_COLOR\fR
.PP
Disables colours in the output (regardless of its value). Can be overridden by \fB\fC--color\fR option.

.PP
See \fB\fChttps://no-color.org/\fR for details.

.SH \fB\fCLS_COLORS\fR, \fB\fCEXA_COLORS\fR
.PP
Specifies the colour scheme used to highlight files based on their name and kind, as well as highlighting metadata and parts of the UI.

.PP
For more information on the format of these environment variables, see the eza_colors.5.md
\[la]eza_colors.5.md\[ra] manual page.


.SH EXIT STATUSES
.TP
0
If everything goes OK.

.TP
1
If there was an I/O error during operation.

.TP
3
If there was a problem with the command-line arguments.
