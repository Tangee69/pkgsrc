# Up to March 2019, the command logging for the wrapped tools didn't properly
# quote the command line arguments. This meant the logging did not reflect
# the actual tool command line.
#
# As of March 2019 the logging has been fixed for tool wrappers that consist
# only of a TOOLS_PATH.${tool} and TOOLS_ARGS.${tool}. For tools with custom
# TOOLS_SCRIPTS it's much more difficult to do the quoting properly. See the
# wrapper for makeinfo for a good example.
