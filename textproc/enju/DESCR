Enju is an accurate natural language parser for English. With a
wide-coverage probabilistic HPSG grammar and an efficient parsing
algorithm, this parser can effectively analyze syntactic/semantic
structures of English sentences and provide a user with phrase
structures and predicate-argument structures.  Those outputs would
be especially useful for high-level NLP applications, including
information extraction, automatic summarization, question answering,
and machine translation, where the "meaning" of a sentence plays
a central role.
