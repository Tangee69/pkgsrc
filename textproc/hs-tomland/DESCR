tomland is a Haskell library for Bidirectional TOML Serialization. It
provides the composable interface for implementing TOML codecs. If you want
to use TOML as a configuration for your tool or application, you can use
tomland to easily convert in both ways between textual TOML representation
and Haskell types.

tomland supports TOML spec version 0.5.0.

The following blog post has more details about the library design and
