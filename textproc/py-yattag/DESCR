Yattag is a Python library for generating HTML or XML in a pythonic
way.  With Yattag,
 - you don't have to worry about closing HTML tags
 - your HTML templates are Python code. Not a weird template
   language. Just Python.
 - you can easily render HTML forms, with defaults values and error
   messages.

It's actually easier and more readable to generate dynamic HTML with
Yattag than to write static HTML.
