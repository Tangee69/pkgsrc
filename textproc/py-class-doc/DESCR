Small set of helpers aimed to extract class attributes documentation from the
class definition. This stuff tries to mimic sphinx-autodoc behaviour as closely
as possible (except instance attributes defined inside __init__ function).

The main advantage of this project over sphinx-autodoc is that it is
lightweight single-purpose dependency, while autodoc just a small part of
really heavy project.
