Dasel (short for data-selector) allows you to query and modify data
structures using selector strings.

Comparable to jq / yq, but supports JSON, YAML, TOML, XML and CSV
with zero runtime dependencies.

Dasel uses a standard selector syntax no matter the data format.
This means that once you learn how to use dasel you immediately
have the ability to query/modify any of the supported data types
without any additional tools or effort.
