unicode-data provides Haskell APIs to efficiently access the Unicode
character database. Performance is the primary goal in the design of this
package.

The Haskell data structures are generated programmatically from the UCD files.
The latest Unicode version supported by this library is 15.1.0
(https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.1.0/).
