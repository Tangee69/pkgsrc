This is a minimal pure-CSS theme for Sphinx that uses the documentation style
of the LV2 plugin specification and related projects.

This theme is geared toward producing beautiful API documentation for C, C++,
and Python that is documented using the standard Sphinx domains. The output
does not use Javascript at all, and some common features are not implemented,
so this theme should not be considered a drop-in replacement for typical Sphinx
themes.
