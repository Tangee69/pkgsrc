Text styling for ANSI terminals using SGR codes, as defined by the ECMA-48
standard.

Supports foreground/background color, bold/faint intensity, italic,
single/double underline, strikethrough, frame, encircle, and overline
escape sequences. Some styles may not work on your terminal.

Also features terminal detection, so redirecting styled output to a file
will automatically strip the ANSI escape sequences.
