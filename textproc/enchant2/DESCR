Enchant aims to provide a simple but comprehensive abstraction for
dealing with different spell checking libraries in a consistent way. A
client, such as a text editor or word processor, need not know
anything about a specific spell-checker, and since all back-ends are
plugins, new spell-checkers can be added without needing any change to
the program using Enchant.

Enchant in pkgsrc can work with the following spell checkers:

    Hunspell
    GNU Aspell
    Zemberek

Note that while enchant, when configured by options to use a spell
checker, simply requires the spell checker package.  It does nothing
about dictionaries for particular languages.
