Do you ever use print() or log() to debug your code? Of course you do.
IceCream, or ic for short, makes print debugging a little sweeter.

ic() is like print(), but better:
1. It prints both expressions/variable names and their values.
2. It's 60% faster to type.
3. Data structures are pretty printed.
4. Output is syntax highlighted.
5. It optionally includes program context: filename, line number, and parent
   function.
