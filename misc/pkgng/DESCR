Pkg is the Next Generation package management tool for FreeBSD.  It is
the replacement for the current pkg_info/pkg_create/pkg_add tools that
ports use to register local packages and which provide remote
packages.  Its main goals are to faciliate remote binary package
upgrades.  It also works with ports without remote binary packages.
