2021Q4 is reported to work with Minix 3.4.0rc6.

Use the `pkgin_sets' script to install the toolchain (clang 3.6), and
the developer tools.  This provides a pre-bootstrapped version of
pkgsrc that is working but out of date.

Then, one can update normally ("bmake update" has been reported to
work).
