Sequel is a database access toolkit for Ruby.  Sequel provides thread
safety, connection pooling, and a concise DSL for constructing queries
and table schemas.

Sequel makes it easy to deal with multiple records without having to
break your teeth on SQL.

This package contains the core components that connect to the underlying
database through database adapters, as well as classes for directly
querying those databases.
