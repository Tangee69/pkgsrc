=== NUTsqlite ===

NUT requires that you install the ascii version of the USDA Nutrient
Database. This database can be install either form the USDA directly
or from http://nut.sourceforge.net/ (sr28nut.zip). This database is
no longer shipped with NUT. These files will need to be extracted
into the same directory as your user's nut.db file. Then you can
use NUT as intended. Please see ${PREFIX}/share/doc/nut/README for
more information.
