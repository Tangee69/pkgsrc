Heel is a small static web server for use when you need a quick web
server for a directory.  Heel is built using Rack and Thin.  Beyond just
serving up webpages, heel uses an ERB template and famfamfam icons to
create useful index pages.  And to make things even easier it launches
your browser for you so no cut and paste necessary.
