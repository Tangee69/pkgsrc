Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized
for speed, ease of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with
content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.

Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you can
run Hugo from any directory.

Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs,
tumbles, and docs.
