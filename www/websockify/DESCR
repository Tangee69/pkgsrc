Websockify is a WebSocket to TCP proxy/bridge. This allows a browser to
connect to any application/server/service.

At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic to
normal socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake, parses
it, and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and the target in
both directions.
