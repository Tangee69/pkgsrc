Because firefox3 is still beta software, it is recommended that you make a
backup of your firefox2 profile incase anything goes wrong.
It is stored in ~/.mozilla/firefox .

If you plan to use both firefox2 and firefox3, it is recommended to create
and use a separate profile for each, by running "firefox -ProfileManager".
