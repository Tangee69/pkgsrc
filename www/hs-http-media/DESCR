This library is intended to be a comprehensive solution to parsing and
selecting quality-indexed values in HTTP headers. It is capable of parsing
both media types and language parameters from the Accept and Content header
families, and can be extended to match against other accept headers as
well. Selecting the appropriate header value is achieved by comparing a
list of server options against the quality-indexed values supplied by the
client.
