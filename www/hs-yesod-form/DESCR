Form handling for Yesod, in the same style as formlets. See the forms
chapter of the Yesod book: http://www.yesodweb.com/book/forms

This package provides a set of basic form inputs such as text, number,
time, checkbox, select, textarea, and etc. via Yesod.Form.Fields
module. Also, there is Yesod.Form.Nic module providing richtext field using
Nic editor. However, this module is grandfathered now and Nic editor is not
actively maintained since June 2012. You can find additional richtext
editor fields in yesod-form-richtext package (currently in provides support
of Summernote editor only).
