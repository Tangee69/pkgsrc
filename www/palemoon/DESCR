independent Pale Moon(tm) codebase, in turn derived from community
code from the Mozilla project.

This package is an UNOFFICIAL build and not to be confused with
official Pale Moon software available from palemoon.org.

No support is provided from Moonchild Productions - all
responsibility for this package falls on the pkgsrc community.

Pale Moon does not support NetBSD and this software has been
modified to enhance NetBSD compatibility.
