This package bundles the minified chart.js code into a Haskell package, so
it can be depended upon by Cabal packages. The first three components of
the version number match the upstream chart.js version. The package is
designed to meet the redistribution requirements of downstream users
(e.g. Debian). This package is a fork of js-flot using chart.js instead of
flot.
