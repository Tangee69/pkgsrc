Hiawatha is an advanced and secure webserver for Unix.

Hiawatha offers protection against SQL injections, Cross-site
Scripting (XSS), Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF) and DoS
attacks.

Hiawatha supports the FastCGI protocol, including load balancing, for
improved CGI performance.

Via Hiawatha's built-in reverse proxy, you can easily integrate other
web solutions or use Hiawatha as an application firewall to protect
other webservers.
