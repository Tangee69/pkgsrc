Fast Base64 stream encoder/decoder

This is an implementation of a base64 stream encoding/decoding
library in C99 with SIMD (AVX2, AVX512, NEON, AArch64/NEON, SSSE3,
SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX) and OpenMP acceleration. It also contains
wrapper functions to encode/decode simple length-delimited strings.
This library aims to be:

- fast
- easy to use
- elegant
