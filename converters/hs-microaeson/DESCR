microaeson aims to provide a RFC 8259 compliant JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON) implementation. The microaeson package provides a smaller subset of
the aeson API with less dependencies and a simpler implementation.

The API is designed in such a way to allow to easily convert client code
written against microaeson's API to use the full aeson API.
