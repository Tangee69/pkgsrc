This is a highly-performant collection of utilities that provide
alternate implementations for parts of the pkgsrc mk infrastructure.

Many targets under pkgsrc/mk are implemented using a combination of
shell and awk, and can suffer from a lack of performance, especially
when the number of input files grows significantly.

The replacement tools provided by mktool can be anywhere from 5 times
up to 500 times faster than the defaults.

Currently pkgsrc requires external patches to enable mktool, from
https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/pkgsrc/tree/dev/mktool, though it
is hoped that these will be committed to pkgsrc at some point in the
future.
