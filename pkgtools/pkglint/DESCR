pkglint checks for typical mistakes and inconsistencies in the source
files of a pkgsrc package.  It produces warnings, errors and notes and,
upon request, explains them.

Before importing a new package or making changes to an existing package,
pkglint should be run in the package's directory to check for common
mistakes.

This is the actively maintained version of pkglint.  Because it is
written in Go, it does not run on all pkgsrc platforms; see also
pkglint4.
