Garamond-Math is an open type math font matching EB Garamond
(Octavio Pardo) and EB Garamond (Georg Mayr-Duffner). Many
mathematical symbols are derived from other fonts, others are
made from scratch. The metric is generated with a Python
script. Issues, bug reports and other contributions are
welcome.
