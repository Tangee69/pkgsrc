The package provides a Type1 version of Libertinus Math, with a
number of additions and changes, plus LaTeX support files that
allow it to serve as a math accompaniment to Libertine under
LaTeX. In addition, with option sansmath, it can function as a
standalone math font with sans serif Roman and Greek letters.
