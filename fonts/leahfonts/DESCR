Leah Fonts is a collection of bitmap fonts designed by Leah Neukirchen,
for those who still prefer a crispier look over TrueType.

Included fonts are:
* sq - 7x15 pixel font inspired by Codec and Quadraat Sans Mono.
  Public domain, 2012. Covers full Latin-1 range. Normal and bold.
* 5x13 - condensed pixel font built on 6x13. A well readable font that
  is only five pixels wide, such that you can fit four 80-chars wide
  shells next to each other on a 1600x1200 display. Partial Latin-1
  support (German subset). Normal only.
* smalltalk10 - the font of the Smalltalk 80 system. A pixel perfect
  restauration of the Smalltalk 80 variable width font "sans-serif 10" as
  provided in the image tape by Mario Wolczko, using the emulator by Dan
  Banay. Covers only printable 7-bit ASCII. Normal shape only.
