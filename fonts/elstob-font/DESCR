The Elstob font (named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Saxonist
Elizabeth Elstob) is based on the Double Pica commissioned by Bishop
John Fell in the seventeenth century. Thus:

It is a variable font, with weights ranging from ExtraLight to
ExtraBold, optical sizes from "Fine Print" (circa 6 points) to
"Display" (circa 18 points or greater) and also a grade axis (1-500).
(A non-variable desktop version is also available.)

Outlines have been kept simple to limit file size.

The intention of the font is to include everything in Unicode useful
to a substantial number of medievalists, but the character set has
been limited to around 1000 glyphs to keep file size reasonable.
Many characters from the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative, present
in the designer's Junicode font, can be represented with combining
diacritics.
