Azeret is a sans-serif typeface with a mono-linear character. Don't
go looking for too much contrast in the strokes! The circular parts
of the letters do not have a smooth connection to the stems. The
x-height is higher than usual and thus the ascenders and descenders
are short. Alternates are also available which open the possibility
of creating different moods. A number of them hint at a nineties
aesthetic.
