BIZ UD Mincho is a universal design typeface designed to be easy to
read and ideal for education and business documentation. It combines
high quality in readability and legibility while carrying on the
stately Japanese Mincho type tradition. BIZ UD Mincho bases its design
on one of the typefaces from the Morisawa font library, which has
thicker horizontal lines than the traditional Mincho type
style. Because most Mincho types have thin horizontal strokes, the
style can be difficult to read on some displays or signs and for
people with low vision. For the universal design version, dakuten and
handakuten voicing marks are designed to be more legible, and the
letterforms are adjusted to maintain their balance while having a
larger face and wider counters.
