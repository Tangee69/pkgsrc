Inspired by Virtual Identity for the Thunderbird email client,
mutt-vid is a similar utility for mutt. It is useful for managing
multiple sender accounts, allowing users to automatically associate
an arbitrary sender account with a recipient. It scans sent emails
for the most recent "From" details associated with each recipient,
saving them in a file for mutt to source. The next time you email
this recipient, mutt will automatically invoke a `send-hook` with
the same email address and real name that you used previously.
