ARC is a technology proposal, put forward by a consortium of organizations,
intended to allow a chain of message handlers (typically email operators)
to confirm handling by trusted upstream handlers in an attempt to confirm
the valid use of certain identifiers in the message.

ARC is still experimental, and its specification may change.  This package
is intended for use by operators willing to take part in the experiment and
provide their feedback to the development team.
