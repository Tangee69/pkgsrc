There's a regression in LibreTLS 3.7.0 (latest) when used with
OpenSSL 3+. OpenSMTPD bundled libtls library implemented a fix in 7.3.0.

If wip/openssl3 is imported in the main tree and LibreTLS isn't updated
in the meantime, the package will most likely need to be built with
bundled libtls. See: https://github.com/OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD/pull/1208
