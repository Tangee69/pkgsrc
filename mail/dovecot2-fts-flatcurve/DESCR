This is a Dovecot FTS (Full Text Search) plugin to enable message indexing
using the Xapian Open Source Search Engine Library.

The plugin relies on Dovecot to do the necessary stemming. It is intended
to act as a simple interface to the Xapian storage/search query functionality.

This driver supports match scoring and substring matches, which means it is
RFC 3501 (IMAP4rev1) compliant (although substring searches are off by default).
This driver does not support fuzzy searches, as there is no built-in support in
Xapian for it.

The driver passes all of the ImapTest search tests.
