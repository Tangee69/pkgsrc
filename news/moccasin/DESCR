TUI feed reader for RSS, Atom, and (eventually) Podcasts. VIM keybindings.
Ranger-inspired interface. Configurable.

On first boot, Moccasin will create both a database and a config file in your
default config directory, which varies depending on your platform.

The moccasin.toml file can be edited to customize app behavior, add feeds in
bulk, change the color scheme, etc. Most of these properties can be changed
from within the application as well, which will write to this file.

To create a custom color scheme, the color_scheme field can be declared as a
table in which the keys are interface elements and the values are either a
built-in ANSI color (which will inherit from your terminal emulator),
a HEX color, or in InlineTable with fg and bg properties of the same type.

The application uses VIM-style keybinds, but arrow keys can also be used for
navigation. At the moment, the app has a NORMAL mode and a COMMAND mode.
In future, you should also be able to tag and group feeds and items in GROUP
mode.
