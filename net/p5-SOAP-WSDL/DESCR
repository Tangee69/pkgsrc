SOAP-WSDL provides a SOAP client with WSDL support.

This module is not recommended for new application development. Please
use XML::Compile::SOAP or SOAP::Lite instead if possible.

This module has a large number of known bugs and is not being actively
developed. This 3.0 release is intended to update the module to pass
tests on newer Perls. This is a service to existing applications
already dependent on this module.
