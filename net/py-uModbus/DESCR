uModbus is a pure Python implementation of the Modbus protocol as
described in the MODBUS Application Protocol Specification V1.1b3.
uModbus implements both a Modbus client (both TCP and RTU) and a
Modbus server (both TCP and RTU). The "u" or "mu" in the name comes
from the the SI prefix "micro-". uModbus is very small and lightweight.
