librsync implements the rolling-checksum algorithm of remote
file synchronization that was popularized by the rsync utility.  This
algorithm transfers the differences between 2 files without needing both
files on the same system.  librsync is for building other programs that
transfer files as efficiently as rsync.  You can use librsync in a program
you write to do backups, distribute binary patches to programs, or
sync directories to a server or between peers.
