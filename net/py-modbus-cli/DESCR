Read and write registers of Modbus devices.

Access both TCP and RTU (i.e. serial) devices and encode and decode
types larger than 16 bits (e.g. floats) into Modbus 16 bits registers.

Optionally access registers by symbolic names, as defined in a
registers file. Symbolic names for enumerations and bitfields are
supported too.

Designed to work nicely with other standard UNIX tools (watch,
socat, etc.), see the examples.
