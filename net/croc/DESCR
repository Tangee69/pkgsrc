Croc is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer
files and folders. Croc may be the only CLI file-transfer tool that does all
of the following:

- Allows any two computers to transfer data (using a relay)
- Provides end-to-end encryption (using PAKE)
- Enables easy cross-platform transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- Allows multiple file transfers
- Allows resuming transfers that are interrupted
- Local server or port-forwarding not needed
- IPv6-first with IPv4 fallback
- Can use proxy, like Tor
