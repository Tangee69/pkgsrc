CLI batch downloader for your Bandcamp collection.

Bandsnatch is a Rust tool for downloading all of your Bandcamp purchases all at
once in your desired format, and being able to be run multiple times when you
buy new releases.

This project is heavily inspired by Ezwen's bandcamp-collection-downloader,
https://framagit.org/Ezwen/bandcamp-collection-downloader, which I used myself
before this, specifically existing to help me learn Rust, but also to add some
improvements over it that I've wanted.

This tool is still currently a work in progress, so bugs and other weirdness may
occur. If anything weird happens or something breaks, please open an issue about
it with information and reproduction steps if possible. Specifically testing use
of this with large collections would be very helpful to see if there's any areas
that I need to improve in.

If you're a developer poking around in the code, please note that this is my
first proper project written using Rust, so code quality may be subpar,
especially in terms of memory usage. If you have any ideas to improve the
project in general I'd love to hear them.
