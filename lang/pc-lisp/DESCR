PC-LISP is a small implementation of LISP for just about any machine with a
good C compiler. This manual is biased towards the UNIX and MS-DOS versions.

While small, it is capable of running a pretty good subset of Franz LISP.
The functions are supposed to perform in the same way as Franz with a few
exceptions made for effeciencies sake.
