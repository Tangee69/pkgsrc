COMMENT=		SBCL, a Common Lisp implementation

ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM=	NetBSD-[2-9]*-i386

# SBCL creates a new release with minor updates and fixes every
# month.  The maintainer of this package does not have the time
# to build, test, update, etc. this package that often.  If you
# would like a newer (or older) version, this works very often:
# 1) change the PKGNAME variable above as desired
# 2) make fetch && make makesum && make package

# It should be possible to have SBCL working on amd64, powerpc,
# sparc, alpha, mips, and HPPA hardware also, but they probably
# need a bit of porting work done in SBCL itself.
# In addition, SBCL should also work on Linux, Darwin, Solaris,
# FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and possibly Win32, OSF/1, HP-UX, and Irix.

# SBCL needs an existing Common Lisp system to build it...
# In theory CLisp, CMUCL, OpenMCL, and SBCL itself should work.
# In practice, CLisp has been a PITA, while CMUCL and OpenMCL
# haven't been ported to NetBSD.  That leaves SBCL itself to
# do the build, so pull in a working binary package of SBCL
# along with the sources when building.
