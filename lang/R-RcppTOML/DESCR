The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to "Tom's
Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format (described at
<https://toml.io/en/>) suitable for both human editing as well as the
common uses of a machine-readable format. This package uses 'Rcpp' to
connect to the 'toml++' parser written by Mark Gillard to R.
