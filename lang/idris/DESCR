Idris is a general purpose language with full dependent types. It is
compiled, with eager evaluation. Dependent types allow types to be
predicated on values, meaning that some aspects of a program's
behaviour can be specified precisely in the type. The language is
closely related to Epigram and Agda. There is a tutorial at
http://www.idris-lang.org/documentation

This package provides Idris 1, which is no longer maintained by
upstream. It's getting harder and harder to keep it compatible with newer
versions of GHC, and next time it breaks we will remove this
package. Existing users should migrate to lang/idris2 urgently.
