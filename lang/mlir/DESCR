The MLIR project is a novel approach to building reusable and extensible
compiler infrastructure. MLIR aims to address software fragmentation, improve
compilation for heterogeneous hardware, significantly reduce the cost of
building domain specific compilers, and aid in connecting existing compilers
together.
