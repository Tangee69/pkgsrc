Meta-package to help in testing rust updates.  It intends to depend on
all maintained packages that use rust, if those packages going missing
would be considered serious.

Note that this package can test rust or rust-bin, depending on one's
RUST_TYPE.

This package does not attempt to test crossbuilding rust itself.
