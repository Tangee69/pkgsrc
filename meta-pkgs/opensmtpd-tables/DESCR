This meta-package provides a number of table integrations for the 
OpenSMTPD mail transfer agent. Available tables include:

* opensmtpd-table-ldap
* opensmtpd-table-mysql (optional)
* opensmtpd-table-passwd
* opensmtpd-table-postgres (optional)
* opensmtpd-table-redis (optional)
* opensmtpd-table-socketmap
* opensmtpd-table-sqlite

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the other packages pulled in by the package dependency
mechanism.
