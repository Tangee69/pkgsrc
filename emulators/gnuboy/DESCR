Welcome to gnuboy, one of the fastest if not the fastest GB/GBC emu-
lator available.

gnuboy was written well over 20 years ago and achieved full speed
on most machines of that era, on today's machines it runs close to
0% CPU usage.

Unlike most modern GB emulators, gnuboy doesn't strive to be
cycle-accurate (except where necessary), but to be fast, portable
and compatible and to provide a good gaming experience.
