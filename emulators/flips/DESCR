Floating IPS (or Flips) is a patcher for IPS and BPS files, aiming
for a simple interface yet plenty of power under the hood.

- Creates the smallest BPS patches of any known tool in existence,
  and is faster than any other comparable creator
- Creates the smallest IPS patches of any known tool in existence,
  too (but only a little smaller, Lunar IPS is quite good)
