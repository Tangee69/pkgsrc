Ishkur is an open source, modular CP/M distribution for the NABU computer.
It is designed to work with both server-based (disk images or native file
access over NHACP) and local storage options.

This package provides a convenient method to install these binaries on
a system that can vend them to a NABU PC using a NABU server, or build
disk images with the binaries using cpmtools.
