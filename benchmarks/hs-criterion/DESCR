This library provides a powerful but simple way to measure software
performance. It provides both a framework for executing and analysing
benchmarks and a set of driver functions that makes it easy to build and
run benchmarks, and to analyse their results.

The fastest way to get started is to read the online tutorial, followed by
the documentation and examples in the Criterion.Main module.
