Provides generic commands \degree, \celsius, \perthousand, \micro
and \ohm which work both in text and maths mode. Various means are
provided to fake the symbols or take them from particular symbol
fonts, if they are not available in the default fonts used in the
document. This should be perfectly transparent at user level, so
that one can apply the same notation for units of measurement in
text and math mode and with arbitrary typefaces. Note that the
package has been designed to work in conjunction with units.sty.

This package used to be part of the was bundle, but has now become
a package in its own right.
