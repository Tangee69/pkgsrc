With etoc loaded, \tableofcontents can be used multiple times,
and an added command \localtableofcontents allows to typeset
"local" tables of contents, i.e. TOCs having their scope
limited to the last sectioning command encountered. Since
release 1.2, also \locallistoffigures and \locallistoftables
are available. Loading etoc per itself does not modify the
"contents lines" inherited from the class default or changed
via other packages. But full usage of the package allows
spectacular effects such as displaying TOCs as trees or mind
maps.
