+- A breaking backward compatibility change: by default the socket 
+  library is not enabled.
+  The new option --socket enable the socket library as 
+  before, as also --shell-escape (without --shell-restricted);
+  --nosocket, --no-socket , --safer disabled the library, and 
+  they have the priority in case of conflicting options.
+  
+  socket.sleep and socket.gettime are duplicated as os.socketsleep and
+  os.socketgettime, both always available.
+  
+  The new function os.kpsepopen replaces io.popen in kpse mode
+  (i.e. when kpse_init is not zero) as it was before,
+  but the permission can no longer be changed with
+  kpse.check_permission.
+  The function os.kpsepopen follows the same restrictions
+  as io.popen.
+
+  The mime library is always available.
+
+  Thanks to Max Chernoff for debugging.
