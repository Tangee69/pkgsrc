Pillow is the "friendly" PIL fork.
The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities to your
Python environment.  This library provides extensive file format support, an
efficient internal representation, and powerful image processing capabilities.

This package is the current version of Pillow, which is available for
Python 3 only.  See devel/py-Pillow6 for an old version which can be
used with Python 2.7.
