KSvg provides both C++ classes and QtQuick components to render svgs based
on image packs.  Compared to plain QSvg, it caches the rendered images on
disk with KImageCache, and can re-color properly crafted svg shapes that
include internal stylesheets.

The default behavior is to re-color with the application palette, making
it possible to create UI elements in SVG.
