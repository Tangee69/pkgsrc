### XXX Prior to this patch, Mesa only allocated executable memory
###	with mmap(2) and PROT_EXEC on linux.  On e.g. OpenBSD and NetBSD,
###	pages which absolutely required PROT_EXEC were allocated using
###	malloc(3).  You may wonder why it only worked on Linux.  Answer:
###	the code was excluded with '#ifdef __linux__'!  "Porting" this
###	[to BSD platforms] involved adding three lines of [preprocessor]
###	code (see patch-ap if you're curious).
###
###	Please do note hack (NetBSD-only for now) I added to wire down
###	this memory by setting the MESA_EXECMEM_MMAP environment variable;
###	you probably don't want it paged out.  MAP_WIRED is probably
###	overkill--I will revisit this at a later date.
###
###	You may also define MESA_EXECMEM_HEAP_SIZE in your build
###	environment to adjust the size of the anonymous executable
###	memory pool (in bytes).  The default is 10MB (huge?).
###
###	Here's the bottom line:  IF YOUR PLATFORM DOES NOT HAVE AN
###	EXECUTABLE HEAP, YOU RUN THE RISK OF MANY SEGMENTATION FAULTS
###	UNLESS THIS OPTION IS ENABLED.  If enabling this option results in
###	build failure, please do file a PR.  Thanks to Owain Ainsworth
###	<oga@openbsd.org> for discovering this.
