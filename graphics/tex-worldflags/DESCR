This is a package for drawing flags using TikZ. Currently the
national flags of all independent nations are included,
additionally some other flags of various organizations. A flag
can be drawn ... as a single TikZ-picture within ordinary text,
as a picture element within a TikZ-picture. The appearance of a
flag (size, frame etc.) can be adapted using optional
parameters.
