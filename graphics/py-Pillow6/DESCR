Pillow is the "friendly" PIL fork.
The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities to your
Python environment.  This library provides extensive file format support, an
efficient internal representation, and powerful image processing capabilities.

This package is Pillow 6, an old version.  It is available because it
can be used with Python 2.7, and the package is only available for
2.7.  See devel/py-Pillow for the currently-maintained version.
