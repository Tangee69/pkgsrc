This package configures the Mozilla rootcerts bundle CAs as trust
anchors in OpenSSL, so that programs using OpenSSL will be able to use
them to validate SSL certificates.  It is for manual installation by
the system administrator only.

For pkgsrc-provided OpenSSL, this package modifies
${PREFIX}/etc/ssl/certs, which belongs to another package.  This is
somewhat irregular as packages should not modify content under etc.

For native OpenSSL, it modifies the base system OpenSSL certificate
directory, e.g. /etc/openssl/certs or /etc/ssl/certs.  This is
necessary to configure trust anchors for native OpenSSL, so that
progams in pkgsrc can use these CA certs in validation.  Modification
of /etc is very irregular as pkgsrc should not write anything outside
of ${PREFIX}.

See also the mozilla-rootcerts package (which this one depends on as a
built-time tool) for placing the Mozilla CA list in the filesystem but
not configuring it into OpenSSL, as well as a script to aid in manual
configuration of trust anchors.

It is policy that no other package may depend on
mozilla-rootcerts-openssl, because any such dependency would modify
system configuration as a side effect of that other package.
