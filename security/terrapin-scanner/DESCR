The Terrapin Vulnerability Scanner is a small utility program written in
Go, which can be used to determine the vulnerability of an SSH client or
server against the Terrapin Attack. The vulnerability scanner requires a
single connection with the peer to gather all supported algorithms.
However, it does not perform a fully fledged SSH key exchange, will
never attempt authentication on a server, and does not perform the
attack in practice. Instead, vulnerability is determined by checking the
supported algorithms and support for known countermeasures (strict key
exchange). This may falsely claim vulnerability in case the peer
supports countermeasures unknown to this tool.
