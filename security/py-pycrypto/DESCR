This is a collection of both secure hash functions (such as SHA256 and
RIPEMD160), and various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, ElGamal,
etc.).  The package is structured to make adding new modules easy.

One possible application of the modules is writing secure administration
tools.  Another application is in writing daemons and servers.  Clients
and servers can encrypt the data being exchanged and mutually
authenticate themselves; daemons can encrypt private data for added
security.  Python also provides a pleasant framework for prototyping and
experimentation with cryptographic algorithms; thanks to its
arbitrary-length integers, public key algorithms are easily implemented.
