oqs-provider provides an Open Quantum Safe provider for OpenSSL (3.x) to
enable quantum-safe cryptography (QSC).

Currently this provider fully enables quantum-safe cryptography for KEM
key establishment in TLS1.3 including management of such keys via the
OpenSSL (3.0) provider interface and hybrid KEM schemes. Also, QSC
signatures including CMS and CMP functionality are available via the
OpenSSL EVP interface. Key persistence is provided via the encode/decode
mechanism, X.509 data structures, and PKCS#12 for bundling a private key
with its corresponding X.509 certificate.
