The Crypt::LE module provides the functionality necessary to use the API of
Let's Encrypt API and other ACME-compatible CAs, and to generate free SSL
certificates for your domains. It can also be used to generate private RSA
and ECC keys or Certificate Signing Requests without resorting to openssl
command line.
