NVDlib is a Python library that allows you to interface with the
NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD), pull vulnerabilities
(CVEs), and Common Platform Enumeration (CPEs) into easily accessible
objects.

### Features

- Search the NVD for CVEs using all parameters allowed by the NVD
  API (recently updated to utilize version 2 of the API). Including
  search criteria such as CVE publish and modification date, keywords,
  severity, score, or CPE name.
- Search CPE names by keywords, CPE match strings, or modification
  dates. Then pull the CVE ID's that are relevant to those CPEs.
- Retrieve details on individual CVEs, their relevant CPE names,
  and more.
- Built in rate limiting according to NIST NVD recommendations.
  Get an API key to allow for a delay argument to be passed. Otherwise
  it is 6 seconds between requests by default.
