This is a low-level library for implementing Hawk Access Authentication,
a simple HTTP request-signing scheme described.

To access resources using Hawk Access Authentication, the client
must have obtained a set of Hawk credentials including an id and
a secret key. They use these credentials to make signed requests
to the server.
