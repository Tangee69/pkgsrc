wxPython is a cross-platform GUI toolkit for the Python programming
language. It allows Python programmers to create programs with a
robust, highly functional graphical user interface, simply and
easily. It is implemented as a set of Python extension modules that
wrap the GUI components of the popular wxWidgets cross platform
library, which is written in C++.

Like Python and wxWidgets, wxPython is Open Source, which means
that it is free for anyone to use and the source code is available
for anyone to look at and modify. And anyone can contribute fixes
or enhancements to the project.

wxPython is a cross-platform toolkit. This means that the same
program will run on multiple platforms without modification.
Currently Supported platforms are Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and
macOS, and Linux or other unix-like systems with GTK2 or GTK3
libraries. In most cases the native widgets are used on each platform
to provide a 100% native look and feel for the application.

Since the programming language is Python, wxPython programs are
simple, easy to write and easy to understand.
