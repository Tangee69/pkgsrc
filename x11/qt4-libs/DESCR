Qt(TM) is a GUI software toolkit.  Qt simplifies the task of writing
and maintaining GUI (graphical user interface) applications.  Qt is a
multi-platform toolkit.  When developing software with Qt, you can run
it on the X Window System (Unix/X11) or Microsoft Windows NT and
Windows 95/98.  Simply recompile your source code on the platform you
want.

This package contains version 4 of Qt, which is EOL; it remains
because some unmaintained useful software still uses it.

NB: This package installs the library substantially into ${PREFIX}/qt4
(except for pkgconfig files) in order to avoid collisions.
