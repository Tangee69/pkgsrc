SLiM is an acronym for Simple Login Manager. SLiM is lightweight
and easy to configure, and requires minimal dependencies - none of
the GNOME or KDE desktop environments or their corresponding
toolkits.

It thus contributes to a lightweight system for users who also like
to use lightweight desktops such as IceWM, Xfce, Openbox, or Fluxbox.
