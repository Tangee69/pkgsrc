This is the Open Source distribution of the XForms Library,
a graphical user interface toolkit for X Windows.

XForms features a rich set of objects, such as buttons, scrollbars,
and menus etc. integrated into an easy and efficient object/event
callback execution model that allows fast and easy construction of
X-applications. In addition, the library is extensible and new objects
can easily be created and added to the library.

This package includes Form Designer (fdesign), a WYSIWYG interface
builder program. fdesign output can also be translated into
Postscript.
