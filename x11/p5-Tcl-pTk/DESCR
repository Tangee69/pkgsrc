Interfaces perl to an existing Tcl/Tk installation on your
computer. It has fully perl/tk compatible syntax for running existing
perl/tk scripts, as well as direct-tcl syntax for using any other
Tcl/Tk features.

Using this module an interpreter object is created, which then
provides access to all the installed Tcl libraries (Tk, Tix, BWidgets,
BLT, etc) and existing features (for example native-looking widgets
using the Tile package).
