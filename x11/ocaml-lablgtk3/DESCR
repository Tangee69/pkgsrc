LablGTK is an Objective Caml interface to GTK+.  It uses the rich type
system of Objective Caml to provide a strongly typed, yet very
comfortable, object-oriented interface to GTK+.  This is not that easy
if you know the dynamic typing approach taken by GTK+.

This is the version currently maintained by upstream, supporting
GTK+ 3.
